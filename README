Usage Recomendation:

To avoid alignment issues you should use pointers to work with math3d structures to work with classes. With things that are allocated on the stack there is no known issue.
Example:

class X {
public:
    X() {
        v = new math3d::vector4;
    }
    
    math3d::vector4 & getV() {
        return *v;
    }
    
    cont math3d::vector4 doMathWithV() {
        // this is allocated on the stack so it will be automatically aligned for you
        math3d::vector4 w;
        return math3d::cross(*v, w);
    }
private:
    // if we had another field before v there would be no guarantee of alignment
    math3d::vector4 * v;
};
